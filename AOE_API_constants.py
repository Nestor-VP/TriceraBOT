# Aoe2.net API Constants
# some useful constants to retrieve the desired data from the Aoe2.net API

## Aoe2:DE leaderboard URL on Ao2.net API
AOE2 = "https://aoe2.net/api/leaderboard?game=aoe2de&leaderboard_id="


## Leaderboard Constants

URK = "0"
### aoe2 RM 1v1 leaderboard id
RM1 = "3"
### aoe2 RM TEAM leaderboard id

## Start and Count string constant 
##( useless for us , because we want to search data for only 1 player ) - but required for using the aoe2 API
## That's why we define Start and count as constant
START= "&start=1&count=1"
